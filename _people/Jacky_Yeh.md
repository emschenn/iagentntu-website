Hello, Chun-Yen (Jacky) Yeh is here. I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan Normal University. 

My current research area is image paragraphing. Teaching machines how to describe images in a more semantically precise way is always my enthusiasm about. Also, I am interested in IoT, serving as TA of "Advanced Topics in Internet of Things" this semester.

At leisure time, I love playing basketball, playing tabletop games, and hanging out with friends. 
Nice to meet you all!
