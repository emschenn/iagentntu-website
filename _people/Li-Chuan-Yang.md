<br />

I'm LiChuan Yang, I graduated from NTUCSIE in 2018!!! And now I am pursuing master degree.
<br><br>
I already had some machine learning knowledge when studying as a bachelor, so I would like to do some further research and application with it. :)
<br><br>
My interests are very broad, such as singing, landscape photographing(you can see them by clicking the link below), swimming, biking!
