Hi, I'm Cheng-Yen Hsieh. My friends usually call me 'Yen'. I'm pursuing MS Degree in National Taiwan University now and my research focus on the topic related to the elderly and edtech. However, I would like to study some skills to analyze the data hoping that I can work as a data scientist one day.
